    <section id="interests">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of interests, both in the world of technology and outside of it. Here are some of the areas I’m passionate about:</p>
    
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Web development is at the core of what I do professionally. I enjoy experimenting with modern frameworks and building intuitive, user-friendly websites. I’m particularly excited by the potential of frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular in creating dynamic, responsive applications.</p>
    
        <h3>Tech Innovations</h3>
        <p>Emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), always excite me. I love staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in these fields and exploring their real-world applications. Whether it's through online courses, tech blogs, or webinars, I’m always looking for ways to expand my knowledge in this area.</p>
    
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>Outside of technology, I'm an avid photographer. I enjoy capturing landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits. Photography helps me appreciate the world from different perspectives, and I often find inspiration in the visuals for my design work.</p>
    
        <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
        <p>I'm a strong advocate for open-source software. Contributing to open-source projects not only helps me sharpen my coding skills but also allows me to collaborate with like-minded developers from all over the world. I’ve contributed to several web development projects on GitHub, and I aim to continue this as a way of giving back to the community.</p>
